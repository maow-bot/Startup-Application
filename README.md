🛠️ Startup Manager Tool
A simple Python tool that ensures selected applications launch on system startup — even if they don’t support it natively.

Why I built this:
I have an app that needs to run for 6+ hours daily, but I kept forgetting to open it. This tool solves that by checking and setting it to run automatically at startup.

Works great for any app that lacks built-in startup options.
